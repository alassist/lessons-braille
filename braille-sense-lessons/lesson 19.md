# Lesson 19: Backup/Restore Personalized Settings

If your units battery ever completely dies, or you have to perform a
hard reset, it is important that you reset the device to your
specifications. To keep you from going through all of the programs and
changing the settings to your specifications all over again, a feature
has been added in order to make it quicker. To backup or restore your
personalized settings, follow the steps below:

1. Open the settings menu.
2. Move to backup/restore personalized settings, and press **ENTER**.
3. The first option in the dialog that appears is a list of the various
    programs that has settings that can be changed. You can move
    through this list and choose the program you want to backup or
    restore, Or use the next control.
4. By pressing tab, (**F3**), you can move to the select all button, this
    selects all areas that have specific settings that can be changed.
5. The next button is backup, and the one after that is restore. When
    you press either of these buttons, depending on what it is you are
    wanting to do at the time, you will be asked for the drive and
    folder to store these settings or that these settings are stored
    on. Select the drive and locate the folder, but do not open the
    folder.
6. Once you are at the folder, press the spacebar, then press **ENTER**. You
    should see a message telling you that the process is running,
    depending on whether you choose backup or restore, the message may
    differ.
