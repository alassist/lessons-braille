# Lesson 12: Using the File Manager

The file manager is a great tool to copy, move, and delete files. You
can view files located on the internal flash disk, or on an external
disk like a thumb drive or SD card. Use the same commands youâ€™ve used
to cut, copy, and paste text to cut, copy, and paste files. To select
multiple files , press **space** when the filename is displayed.

If you move to a drive and want to move to another, press
the**backspace** to back out of that drive, back to the previous list.

To translate a file from one format to another, when you are on that
file, press **Enter with T**, then choose the file type to translate
to, and press **ENTER**. The translated file will be placed in the drive
and or folder you are in.
