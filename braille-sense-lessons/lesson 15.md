# Lesson 15: Using the Built-in Manual

Near the bottom of the main menu you will find the Help option. This
option will open the built-in manual which you can read by first
selecting a topic you want to read about and press enter. Use normal
cursor movement keystrokes to read the manual. When you are done,
press **space with Z**until you return to the main menu.
