# Lesson 3: WORD PROCESSOR

The word processor is where you can write and edit documents. It is not as powerful as Microsoft Word, but can be used for formatting text and other intermediate uses. You can always transfer the document to your computer for further editing, if needed.

## Creating A File

When the Word Processor is open, a blank document is displayed. If you need another document while working in the Word processor, You can press **ENTER with N**, for "new". You will immediately be given a new document of the same type you currently have open. The Braille Sense Polaris creates all documents in the DOCX Microsoft Word format. To have a document in a different format, you can translate the file to a different type.

**NOTE**: If your current document has changes that haven't been saved,
you will be asked to save these before a new document will be created.

## Cursor Movement Commands

The following commands move the cursor around within a document.

<dl>
<dt>Top of file</dt>
<dd>space with dots 1-2-3</dd>

## Formatting Features

Formatting a document on the Braille Sense Polaris is not as powerful as formatting in Microsoft Word or Google Docs on a computer. However, many different formatting options are available that can be included in documents. The following steps will provide instructions on how to use these formatting features:

1. The formatting features can be used after the text of the document has been typed, by selecting the text you’d like to format. Move to the beginning of the text, then use the start selection feature by pressing **Enter with B**, and move to the end of the text to be selected. To select the entire document press **Enter with A**, for "select all."
2. Open the Layout menu by pressing **F2** then pressing **Space with Dot
    4** to Layout, pressing **Enter**, and **Space with dot 1** to
    Print Paragraph Layout. This layout is for a document that is to
    be printed.
3. The following lists are the choices available for formatting to this
    document, use the up or down arrow (press dot 1 space or dot 4
    space) to move through the choices:

    -   Set Left Margin
    -   Set Right Margin
    -   Indent first line
    -   Indent All Lines
    -   Alignment: Left Justified (press space to change).
    -   Set Style: Text (press space to change).

4. There are other formatting options under the Print Document Layout.
    These are listed below:

    -   Set top Margin
    -   Set bottom Margin
    -   Set left Margin
    -   Set Right Margin
    -   Set Page Number
    -   Header (enter your text for a header here)
    -   Footer (enter your text for a footer here)
-   Distance between lines

	<aside>
	<p>NOTE: To adjust all of the margin settings for the top, bottom, left and
	right go to the print document layout.
	</aside>

## Changing Font

The Font feature is found under the Layout menu, or press **backspace with M** to open the font settings dialog.

The features you can change under the font settings dialog are listed below. Please note you will have to use the **F3** key to move from feature to feature.

- Font - this allows you to choose what style of font you want. The font deals with the look of the letters on the page, whether they are in block style letters (handwriting), or actually tiny pictures. You can use the space and backspace to move through this list.
- Font Style - this allows setting such features as italics or thickly
    or bold options.
- Font Size - This allows you to adjust the size of the letters on the
    page. You will set this size in points. 12 point is usually about
    normal print size whereas 72 point the letters are 1 inch tall.
- Color - This allows you to set the color of the text, whether it is
    red, green, yellow, blue, white, or black or whatever color you
    choose.
- Underscore - this allows you to set the underline style, whether it
    is a single, double, or triple underline. There are some other
    options like wavy line, dot dash underline, etc.
- Underline color -  allows you to select the color of the underline.
-   Strike out - this allows you to set the strikeout for text.
-   Subscript - this allows you to set the text to subscript.
-   Typography
-   Letter Spacing - determines the distance between letters.
-   Letter Spacing Value - this is the value set for letter spacing if
    you need this feature.

## Saving a Document

It is necessary to save documents that you have created, for future reference or to have later. This process is rather simple, especially if you are saving to the "My Documents" folder, but can be a little more complex when saving to other folders or on other drives. Please note however that if you are saving to a drive to open on a computer, you will need to save it as a different file format, such as that can be opened on the computer. Examples of document formats that can be opened on a computer include: .doc, .docx, .txt, and .rtf file formats. The following steps will walk you through saving a file.

1. Once you are ready to save your document, press **F2** to open the menus.
2. Press **enter** on file.
3. Using the down arrow command (**space with dot 4**) move to save, and
press **enter**.
4. You will be asked for a filename. If you want to save the file on
the internal disk named the Flash Disk and in the my documents folder,
simply type the filename and press **ENTER**. If You Want to save this
file on another drive or in a different folder, follow the steps below.
5. Press shift tab, (**space with F3**), to move to the file list. If you
want to save to a different folder on the My documents folder, select
it now. Or press **BACKSPACE** once to select a different folder on the
internal disk.
6. To save the file to a different drive, press **BACKSPACE** until the
Braille Sense says Flash Disk. Now using the up or down arrow, (**space
with dot 1** or **space with dot 4**) select the drive you want to save this
file too and press **ENTER**. Please note that drives are labeled as
follows: SD Card is called "SD Card", whereas a Thumb Drive or flash
Drive is called a "USB Drive" because it was connected using the USB
port.
7. If you want to save this file to a specific folder on that drive,
use the up or down arrow, (**space with dot 1** or **space with dot 4**), to
find that folder, and press **ENTER**. A tip to help you locate the folder
is the ability to use first letter navigation. This means
that you can press the first letter of the folder you are looking for
and it will jump to folders or files that begin with that letter.
8. Press tab, (**F3**) to move to the filename edit box, type the name
for the file, and press **ENTER**.

**NOTE**: An easier way to activate the save option is to use the shortcut key command of **ENTER with S**.

**NOTE**: The main difference between save and save as is you can save the file elsewhere in another format when using save as.

**NOTE**: With previous versions you could choose what file type to save to, however with the Braille Sense Polaris, this option is no longer available. Further along in these lessons, you will be taught how to translate a file to a specific format.

## Opening a File

1. After you open the Word Processor, press **F2** to activate the menu.
2. Use the down arrow, (**space with dot 4**), until you find file, and
press **ENTER**.
3. Use the down arrow until you find open, and
press **ENTER**.
4. You will be in a dialog box similar to that of the save dialog. If
you want to open a file, and you know the exact name, type it in the
filename box, and press **ENTER**. The file will then open.

	If you want to open a file that is on a specific drive, press
	shift-tab, (**space with F3**), to move to the file list. If the file
	you want to open is in the "My Documents" folder, you can use what is
	called "first letter navigation" to jump to the files that start with
	a particular letter and locate the file, then press **ENTER** to open
	it. For example, if you were looking for a file named, "Science",
	pressing the letter S, you will move to the first file or folder that
	starts with S, then use the up or down arrow to locate your file. On
	the other hand, if you don’t find the right file on the first press of
	the letter, you can continue pressing S until you find the file you
	are looking for, and press **ENTER** to open it. Please note, however,
	that the first letter navigation works in whatever folder you may be
	in at the time.

5. If the file you want to open is on a different drive, press **BACKSPACE** until the Braille Sense says "Flash Disk". Now, using the up or down arrow, (**space with dot 1** or **space with dot 4**) to select the drive that contains this file, and press **enter**.
6. If this file is in a specific folder on this disk, use the up or
down arrows to find that folder, and press **ENTER**.

Now use the up or down arrow keys to locate that file, and press **ENTER**.

NOTE: First letter navigation is a great time saver. All files and folders are stored in the drives in alphabetic order, so using the first letter of the filename helps to locate the files that you have on this particular drive starting with that letter. Also, the folders on a particular drive are listed first in the list then the individual files follow.

NOTE: You can use the shortcut command of **Enter with O** to open a document.

## Printing with the Braille Sense Polaris

Before you start printing, you will want to ensure that your Braille Sense is connected to the printer using a USB cable.

1. Open the document you wish to print.
2. Press **Space with P** to print. The print command can
also be found on the File Menu.
3. You will be in a list, the first option is emboss, so move down to the
printer you are printing with, and press **ENTER**.
4. After you press enter, a list of settings are displayed. They are as
follows:

	- Start page number 1 (you can enter a number if you choose to start on a specific page).
   - End page number 100000 (you can enter a number if you want to end on a
   specific page).
   - Number of copies 1 (you can enter a number if you need more than one
   copy).

5. Tab to confirm and press **ENTER**.
6. You will be asked if you are ready to print. Enter "Y" for yes, or "N" for
no. If you choose yes, the printer should print your document. If you
happen to choose no, the print dialog will close and the printing is
canceled.

**NOTE**: The printer settings are set under the Layout menu and under Print Document Layout. Use this feature if you need to adjust any settings when printing.

## Embossing a Document

If you happen to have access to a Braille Embosser, it is often good to have hard copy Braille available. To emboss documents from the Braille Sense Polaris, follow the steps below. As with printing, make sure you are connected to the embosser with a USB cable.

1. Open the document you wish to emboss.
2. Press **Space with P** to emboss.
3. You will be in a list. The first option is emboss, so press **ENTER**.
4. After you press **ENTER**, a list of settings are displayed, which are as
follows:

    - Start page number - 1 (you can enter a number if you choose to start on a specific page).
        - End page number - 100000 (you can enter a number if you want).
            - Number of copies - 1 (you can enter a number if you need more than one
            copy).
                - Set Braille Format - Yes (if this is set to Yes, then the document is
                embossed using the settings specified on the Braille Sense. If it is set to
                No, then it uses the setting specified on the embosser).

5. Tab to confirm, and press **enter**.
6. You will be asked if you are ready to emboss. Enter "Y" for yes, or
"N" for no. If you choose yes, the embosser should emboss your document. If
you choose no, the embossing of the document is canceled.

**NOTE**: it is not necessary to translate this document to emboss it, all
of that is taken care of automatically.

**NOTE**: To adjust options for embossing, open the Layout menu and choose
Braille Document layout. A dialog box is opened with the settings for
embossing.

## Using the Spell Checker

It is important for everything you do to look as neat and correct as possible. While it is still necessary to proofread a document, the spell checker can help when there are problems with spelling words. To use the spell checker, use the following commands:

1. After the document has been typed, move to the top of the document by pressing **Space with dots 1-2-3**.
2. Now press **ENTER With K** to open the spellchecker. You will
    be placed in a menu of choices. These are whole document,
    paragraph, and current word. These options decide what area to
    check. Choose "whole document" and press **ENTER**.
3. When a misspelling is found, it will be displayed. At this point, you
    have several options. Please note that this is a dialog box, and you will
    have to tab from option to option. The following are the options
    you have while tabbing after a misspelled word is found:

	-   Change Word - this allows you to retype the correct word.
    -   Suggestions - this provides suggestions for the word you are trying
        to spell.
    -   Skip Once - Use this option if you want to skip this misspelling
        once.
    -   Skip All - Use this to skip all occurrence of the misspelled word.
    -   Add to Dictionary - Use this ONLY if the word is spelled
        correctly and the dictionary says it is not. It is imperative
        that the word is spelled correctly, otherwise it will bypass
        the misspelled word next time.
    -   Modify Once - This option is used to change the misspelling once in
        the document.
    -   Modify All - This option is to change all occurrences of the
        misspelled word in the document.

**NOTE**: As stated above, spell checking is useful, however it is still
necessary to proofread documents. Sometimes the entirely wrong word
can accidentally be used, for example, if you had the sentence, "Bill
went two the store." The word two is incorrect, but the spell checker
will not catch this, because the word is spelled correctly.
