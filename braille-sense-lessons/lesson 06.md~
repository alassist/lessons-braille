# Lesson 6: ADDRESS MANAGER

The address manager is an address book. Use this feature to store, look up, and manage contact information.

## Adding An Address

1. Open the address manager.
2. Press **F2** to pull down the menus. The first option is add address,
press **ENTER** on this option.
3. Enter information into the fields for which you have information,
using the Up and Down arrow commands to move between fields.
4. When you have entered all the information you have, press **ENTER**
to save the record to the address manager.

Note: A quick key command to enter a new address is to press **ENTER
with I**.

Note: Once you have activated the add address option, it will remain open
until you choose another option from the menus. Therefore, if you need
to enter multiple addresses, do so here.

## Searching For Addresses

When you open the address manager, it automatically goes into search
mode. If you need to open the search mode just open the menu with F2
and Search for addresses is displayed, then press enter. Type the
information in the field you want to use to search by, then press
**ENTER**. It is possible to search for addresses using any of the fields
displayed, but only results will be displayed that have this
information. You will be in a list of a number of results found then
