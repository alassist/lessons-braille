# Lesson 20: Operating System

Because the Braille Sense Polaris is running the Android Operating
System, you will see options near the bottom of the main menu for the
Play Store and All Apps. Please note that not all applications built
for the Android Operating System will work on the Braille Sense
Polaris, or may not be accessible to the screen reader. However, there
are some applications that do work well, and may add desired
functionality. Some of these include applications for taking pictures
of documents and having the speech read that document to you. Other
applications such as those made by Google are accessible and work well
on the Braille Sense Polaris. There are several applications loaded by
default onto the Polaris, and these can be seen by going to "All
Applications". Basically, to determine whether an application will work
on the Polaris is on a trial and error basis.
