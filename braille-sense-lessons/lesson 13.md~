# Lesson 13: BLUETOOTH MANAGER

The Bluetooth manager is used to establish connections via Bluetooth
from the Braille Sense to other devices using Bluetooth. These devices
could vary from printers, speakers, keyboards, and even cellphones or
tablet PC's. When you start Bluetooth manager, it automatically begins
to search for Bluetooth devices. If they are found, it will display
them in a list. You can connect to these devices by pressing **ENTER** on
them.
