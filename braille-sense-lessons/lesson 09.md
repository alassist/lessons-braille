# Lesson 9: EMAIL

The Email program on the Braille Sense Polaris allows you to send and receive email from multiple accounts in speech or braille.

You will have to set up at least one account before you can send and receive emails. The following steps will guide you in doing this.

## Setting Up Email

1. While on the Main Programs menu, press the letter "E" to open Email.
2. Press the **F2** key to open the menus, arrow to Tools, and press
**ENTER**.
3. The first option is Accounts Manager. Press **enter** to activate
   this.
4. Press **TAB** until you find "Add Account", and press **ENTER**.
5. You will need information from your email service provider to fill
in the following fields.

	* Account Name
   * Display Name
   * Username
   * Password
   * Email Address
   * Using Default Mail Server
   * Incoming Pop Server
   * Outgoing SMTP Server

	**NOTE**: Some of these settings may require information from you, whereas others may be drop down boxes with options to choose. Press the **space** to cycle through the options available in these boxes.

5. Once you have filled in all required information, press TAB (**F3**)
    until you get to the Confirm button, and press **ENTER**.

## Reading Email

To read email once you have opened it, you will be in a list of mail. Use the arrow key commands to find the mail you want to read, and press **ENTER**. You may need to choose a folder, like "inbox" to read mail from first. To exit the mail, press **space with E** or **F4**.
