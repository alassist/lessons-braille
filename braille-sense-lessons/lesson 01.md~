# Lesson 1: Layout

## Left Side

Moving from front to back, you will find a standard USB port, along
with a headphone and microphone jack. Also on this side, you will find
2 small buttons which are the volume up and volume down buttons.

## Back of Unit

Moving across the unit from left to right you have a standard USB port
and a power jack on the far right end. Please note that there is an
opening between the power jack and the USB port. This opening is for a
device that will lock this unit to the table where it is. This device
must be purchased separately and requires being bolted down to the
table in order for it to work.

## Right Side

Starting from the front you will find a USB C port and a Secure Digital
(SD) Card Slot.

## Front of Unit

From left to right, a lock switch, a mode switch, 5 buttons which are
media controls: rewind, record, stop, play/pause, and fast
forward. The last switch on the front right-hand end of the unit is
the power on/off switch.

## Top of Unit

There is a standard 6 dot Braille keyboard with Enter on the far right and
backspace on the far left. The spacebar is between the keys for dot 1
and dot 4. On either side of the spacebar, you will find 2 buttons,
these are alt & control. Beyond the alt and control buttons you will
find 2 buttons on each side, (4 in all) these are function keys,
starting from the far left button moving to the right: F1, F2,
F3, and F4. Below the spacebar, you have a 32 cell Braille display,
with cursor routing buttons above each cell of the display. At each
end of the Braille display, you have2 buttons one above the other.
These are to scroll the display. The buttons do the same unless this
setting is changed in Global settings. The bottom buttons on either
side scroll the display forward by the length of the display, and the top two
buttons scroll the display backward by the length of the display. These make it
easier when reading a document.
