purpose of this section is to cover those that will. To open Utilities
from the Main Menu, press the letter "U".

## Display Compass Heading

this feature displays the compass heading. First, lay the unit on a flat surface, then activate this
feature. As the unit is turned, the compass heading will change.

to a dialog which you can tab (**F3**) or shift tab (**space + F3**)
through and change the settings. There are 3 different alarm sounds to
choose from.

date happened? Enter that date into the calendar using the number sign

number sign and the year. Now press **ENTER**, and the day of the week

also includes a countdown timer. To start the stopwatch, press **ENTER**.
The time will show on the Braille display. To stop the stopwatch, press

## Using the Built-In LCD Display

at the top of the unit, in the center is a LCD Display which will
display what is happening on the Braille Sense. To use this display
follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings menu with the letter O and the spacebar, and move
    down to "LCD: Off" press the spacebar to turn this feature "On
    with backlight"or space again to just turn it on.

2. If someone else is going to be using the display and they are across
    the table from the Braille Sense you will want to "Flip the
    Display" which is the next option that you can turn on with space
    bar.

3. Another feature that is handy is the ability to enlargen the text on
    the display. This feature is below the "Flip the Display" and
    allows you to set the "Font Size" from 12 point up to 20 point.

4. If a monitor and a USB cable is handy the next option might help.
    This is to turn on the "Video Display". Use the space bar to turn
    it on or off.

## Play Power On/Off Sounds

This is a function that some users like, and others don't. When the
Braille Sense is turned on, you will hear some music, and you will hear
music when it is turned off. If you do not want this, go to Settings,
move to the "Play Power On/Off Sound" and press **space** to turn
this off. Then press the **ENTER** key to confirm your setting.

## Automatic Spell Check

Having the option to spell check a document is nice, however there are
times when a person doesn't have time to spell check documents. Why
not make it where you can hear a sound or the unit will vibrate when
you make a mistake in spelling? This option can also be turned on in
the Settings menu.
