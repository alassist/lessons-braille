# Lesson 11: Using Cut, Copy, & Paste

The ability to move information around is a great tool of the computer.
You can move text or files around as well with the Braille Sense.

1. Move the cursor to the beginning of the text to be moved.
2. Press **ENTER with B** to start selection.
3. Move the cursor to the end of the text you want to deal with. Press
    **Enter with X** to cut the text. This completely removes it from
    its current location, and allows you to move it to another. You
    can use the copy command by pressing **enter with C**. This leaves
    the text in its current location and makes a copy on the
    clipboard.
4. Move to the location you want to position the text, and press **ENTER
    with V** to paste the text there.

NOTE: The clipboard is a temporary storage area where text that is cut
or copied is stored. Please note however that once something else has
been cut or copied the first text is deleted and replaced by the new
block of text. Also, if you need several copies of the information
from the clipboard, press the paste command as many times as you need
this information, and you will have that many copies of the
information in the file, and still stored on the clipboard.
