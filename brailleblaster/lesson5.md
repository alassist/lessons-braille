# Lesson 5: conclusion

## Introduction

In this course, you’ve learned to use the BrailleBlaster program.
You’ve learned how to download the program, install it, open files,
create new files, save files, use the menu bar, translate and emboss
braille, and edit and format documents.

Now, let’s put that knowledge into practice. In this lesson, you will
create a document, edit it, format it, see the braille output, and
emboss it if you like.

## Steps to complete

- If you have not already done so, download and install BrailleBlaster.
- Open BrailleBlaster.
- In BrailleBlaster, type the following text:
> This is a test of the braille translation system.

- Using the styles menu, italicize the word “test” in the text you’ve written.
- View the translated text to make sure that the braille is accurate.
- Save the file as “test”, and close BrailleBlaster.
- Open BrailleBlaster again and open the “test” file you saved.
- (optional) Emboss the file, if you have an embosser connected.
