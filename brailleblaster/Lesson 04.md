# Lesson 4: formatting files

## Introduction

When making a print document, you usually do not have to worry about
formatting. You make paragraphs, add links, make tables, and maybe
even make headings using the correct heading style. It is good to use
the correct style in print, as it then is more understandable to
screen reader users, but it is not necessary to most people.

However, in braille, it is necessary to format documents if you wish
to convey the correct meaning of text. For example, a heading in print
is just large, bold text separated from other text. In Braille,
though, headings are centered on the page, and it would take longer to
put the correct number of spaces in the document to match the paper
width than it would to simply apply the heading style.

## How to add styles

To add a style, open the menu bar and choose the styles menu. In this
menu, you’ll have a category of styles, with the styles themselves in
the categories. When you choose a style, like "centered heading,"
you’ll placed back into the document, where you can write your text in
that style.

If your text is not styled, try selecting the text which you want the
style applied.
