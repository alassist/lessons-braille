## Concepts covered

## Basic usage of BrailleBlaster

After you have installed BrailleBlaster, you can open it through the
icon on the desktop or the start screen on Windows, the applications
folder on Mac, or the applications menu on Linux.

After Brailleblaster launches, you'll be in an empty text document, in
which you may type text for translation into braille. Use normal
navigation commands, like the arrow keys, page up and down, home and
end, and selection commands along with your screen reader's reading and
navigation commands to navigate the text field. When you reach the
boundary of the field, top or bottum, you'll hear a beep to let you know
that you cannot move further in that direction.

You can open a file with CTRL+O, and browse your computer for a file,
or make a new one with CTRL+N, although the edit area you are in is a
new file already. If you want to save this file, press CTRL+S, and
you'll be in a normal "Save" Dialog box.

## getting help

Before you learn more about BrailleBlaster, it is a good idea to know
how to get help within the program. The help menu has plenty of material
and contact methods to give you the help you need with the program.
Specifically, the User Guide has information on all commands and
concepts you need to know about the program. To enter the Help menu,
press Alt+H on Windows, or VO+M, then press H, then down arrow on Mac,
or press F10, then press H on Linux. Below is a list of the help items
in BrailleBlaster. Press enter on an item to activate it.

For now, type some text into the empty document, to have it translated.
For example:

> This is a test.

Now that we have some text, let's translate it into braille. There are
two ways of translating: saving a translated Braille file, or viewing
the text as it would be translated. To view the translation, press
ALT+HOME on Windows, Option+Home on Mac, or choose it from the file menu
on Windows, Mac, or Linux. You'll read the following in a text box:

> ,? is a te/4

To save this as a Braille Ready File (BRF) or Portable Embosser Format
file (PEF), choose "Save as BRF/PEF" from the File menu.

To open a document you've recently worked on, go to the file menu and
open the "recent files" menu. To print a file, before embossing, press
Control+P on Windows, Command+P on Mac, or Control+P on Linux. the
printing dialog box of your operating system will appear, where you can
choose a printer and print the file.

To emboss a file, press Control+E on Windows, Command+E on Mac, or
Control+E on Linux. You'll be asked if you want to set up an embosser
profile, so choose yes. You'll be asked to name your embosser, choose
its manufacturer, and its model. Answer all questions on the screen,
tabbing through the settings and using arrow keys to select, or typing
in, requested information. After you press the "ok" button to continue,
you will be able to emboss your file.
