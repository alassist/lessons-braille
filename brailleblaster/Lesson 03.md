# Lesson 3: a Workflow for existing files

With BrailleBlaster, you can open many different types of files to
work with. These documents can then be read, edited, converted, and
embossed into braille.

## Concepts covered

In this lesson, you will learn to:

- Open files
- Read opened files
- Edit opened files
- Convert files to braille
- Emboss files

### Open Files

First, open BrailleBlaster. You can do this from the windows Start
Menu or desktop. When BrailleBlaster opens, you will be
placed into an empty document. To open a document you already have,
press CTRL+O on Windows, Command+O on Mac, or Control+O on Linux.

BrailleBlaster can open many different types of files. Besides its own
file formats, it can open braille files (.brf and .brl), documents
(.txt, .docx, DOC), EBooks (.epub). All of these formats can be
converted into braille or embossed. Open the file using the standard
Open File dialog box that appears.

After you have chosen a file, BrailleBlaster will open it and display
it in print onscreen.

### Read opened files

With a file opened, we can now read the file, either in print or
braille. After the file is opened, print view is shown. To move around
in the text, use your arrow keys for basic navigation.

In the menu bar, there is a “navigate” option. Within that menu, there
are several options that make navigation more quick.

<dl>
<dt>Go to Page</dt>
<dd>Allows you to choose a page in the document, and go directly to
that page</dd>
<dt>Home</dt>
<dd>Go to the beginning of the document</dd>
<dt>End</dt>
<dd>Go to the end of the document</dd>
<dt>Book Tree</dt>
<dd>Open a list of headings in the file</dd>
<dt>Next Element</dt>
<dd>Go to the next heading</dd>
<dt>Previous Element</dt>
<dd>Go to the previous heading</dd>
<dt>Next Page</dt>
<dd>Go to the next page</dd>
<dt>Previous Page</dt>
<dd>Go to the previous page</dd>
</dl>

### Edit open files

You can edit open files if necessary, fixing formatting issues  or
insert different items.

Using the Menu Bar, explore the Edit, Tools, Emphasis, Styles, and
Insert menu. To activate any option you wish, press Enter, or Return
key on Mac or Linux.

### Convert files to braille

To convert the opened file into braille, press Alt+Home on Windows and
Linux, Option+Home on Mac. A text field will pop up, allowing you to
read the file you have opened, translated into braille.

### Emboss files

To emboss a file, now that you’ve opened, read, edited, and seen the
translation into braille, go to the menu bar of BrailleBlaster. Enter
the file menu, and find the Emboss option. Along with the "emboss"
item name, you’ll hear a shortcut command that you can use instead of
the menu to activate the emboss function.

After choosing to emboss the file, you’ll be given options for which
embosser to use, and other settings on how to emboss the file. Press
enter when you’re ready to emboss the file..
