# Using the Braille Note Touch as a Braille Display

Using the Braille Terminal, you can connect the Braille Note Touch
Plus to other devices, like an iPhone, a Windows, Mac, or Linux
computer, or another Android phone, using wired USB, or wireless
Bluetooth. The device that you want to connect the Braille Note to
must be running a screen reader. The Braille Note’s screen reader with
be interfacing with the connected device’s screen reader to provide
input from the braille Note, and output from the other screen reader.

Note that when using the Touch in the Braille Terminal app, standard
KeySoft commands such as Help, Main Menu, and Context Menu are not
active using their keyboard shortcuts. If you need to go back to the
main menu from the Braille Terminal, simply press the Home button on the
front face of the Braille Note Touch. While the Braille Terminal app
is still open in the background, the pairing or connection to the 
secondary computer or mobile device will remain open. This allows you
to switch to another app on the Touch and switch back to the Braille
Terminal app when needed, without needing to repair the connection
with the secondary device. If you close Braille Terminal completely
from the recent apps list, then the connection to the secondary
device will be severed.

When you start the braille Terminal app, you can choose between
Bluetooth or USB. You can then pair your other device to the Braille
Note Touch Plus. The Braille Note Touch Plus will show up as “Brailliant / BrailleNote
Touch” in the connected device’s Bluetooth settings if you choose to
connect through Bluetooth. If you connect through USB, just plug in
the power cable and start the screen reader, and configure the screen
reader to try to connect to the braille Note Touch if you are on
Windows. If you’re on Mac, Linux, or ChromeOS, VoiceOver, BRLTTY (if
started), or ChromeVox, respectively, should detect the BrailleNote
Touch and use it automatically.
