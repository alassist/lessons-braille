# Navigating the Braille Note Touch Plus

When you start the Braille Note Touch Plus for the first time, you’ll
be guided through how to use the device. If you haven’t gone through the
tutorial, it is recommended that you do so.

There are many ways to navigate the Braille Note Touch:

* The hardware Braille keyboard
* Touch Braille
* Explore by Touch
* A QWERTY keyboard
* The Thumb keys and Cursor Routing buttons

## Using the Hardware Braille keyboard

The hardware Braille keyboard can be used to navigate by “first letter
navigation,” or through commands to move by a certain amount. To use
first letter navigation, type the letter of an item on the screen. For
example, while in the Main Menu, typing “a”, without the quotes, will
move you to the “All Applications” menu item. This allows you to
quickly move to different items once you know what you’re looking for.
If typing the letter once doesn’t get you to the right item, type that
letter again to move to the next item that begins with that letter.

To move forward one item, you have two options: pressing **Space with Dot 4**
moves forward one item. You can also just use the Space bar to move
forward one item.

To move back, use **Space with Dot 1**, or Backspace. Both keys move
backward one item. If you move to the end, or bottom, of the screen,
pressing the last used navigation command, either moving forward
passed the end or bottom, or moving backward, passed the beginning or
first, will wrap around to the beginning, from the end, or the end,
from the beginning.

The following are general commands to use with the braille keyboard,

## Using Touch Braille

Touch Braille is a method of typing on the touchscreen in braille. It
allows for silent, ergonomic, quick, and comfortable typing. To
use it, place all ten fingers anywhere on the touchscreen, as though
you are placing your fingers on the hardware braille keyboard. When
you have your fingers settled on the screen, you’ll feel a small
vibration. If your fingers aren’t on the screen correctly, you’ll feel
a long, sharp vibration to warn you. Once you feel the short
vibration, you can use the touch screen exactly the same way you use
the hardware braille keyboard, using the same commands, and first
letter navigation, as above to navigate.

### Tips for using Touch Braille

* Keep your wrists down, on the device, to the sides of the braille
  display, where the two speakers are.
* After your fingers are recognized, lift your fingers slightly when
  typing, but don’t move your hands from their original positions.
* Type with the pads of your fingers, not the tips.
* Every few minutes, you’ll need to reinitialize the finger
  recognition. You’ll feel a long, sharp vibration when this is
  needed.
* Keep practicing and experimenting with what works best when typing
  with Touch Braille.

## Explore by Touch

Explore by Touch is similar to navigating using an iPhone or normal
Android phone or tablet. You use one finger to either feel across the
screen to find items, or swipe or flick with one finger to move one
item at a time. Swiping right will move to the next item. Swiping left
will move to the previous item. To activate an item, just double-tap.

## A QWERTY keyboard

A QWERTY keyboard can be used to navigate the Braille Note Touch Plus.
