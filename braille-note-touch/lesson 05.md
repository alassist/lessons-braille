# The Main Menu

The Main Menu is what you use to launch all other programs or apps.
After unlocking your device, you are placed into the Main Menu
automatically.

To get to the main menu, you can press the Home button, or use **Space
with dots 1-2-3-4-5-6**.

The apps in the Main Menu include:

* Contacts: Stores all contacts in Email and Google Contacts.
* Email: Allows you to read and write email.
* Internet: Allows you to browse the Internet with Google Chrome.
* Word Processor: Allows you to write documents.
* Planner: Allows you to setup appointments.
* File Manager: Allows you to browse your files on the device and
  external media
* Calculator: Allows you to use a scientific calculator
* EasyReader Plus: Allows you to read books
* Play Store: Allows you to download apps
* KNFB Reader: Allows you to scan printed pages and read them in
  braille or listen to them with speech.
* Braille Terminal: Allows you to use the device as a braille display
  with computers or phones.
* All applications: Shows a full list of applications, including
  Google apps and any apps you download from the Play Store.

You can use first letter navigation to get to items on the Main Menu,
just like everywhere else in the system. For example, you can press
“C” without quotes, to get to the Contacts app, “e” for Email, “i” for
Internet, or “b” for Braille Terminal.
