# Calculating

The Braille Note Touch Plus comes with a calculator. It can do simple
math, as well as more advanced equations. It cannot do more advanced
Algebra, like Matrices and Systems of Equations.

To launch the calculator, find it in the Main menu.

In order to perform a calculation, just type it into the edit field
provided in your preferred braille code. For example, you can use
Nemeth Code. In the calculator, you donâ€™t have the type a number sign
before typing the equation to be calculated, as it already knows that
you are in calculation mode. You can, however, use a number sign if
you want; it will not effect the outcome of the calculation.
