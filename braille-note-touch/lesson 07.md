# Reading books

Reading books can be achieved with the Easy Reader Plus program. It is
the same Easy Reader app that is on Android and iOS already, but it
has been optimized for the Braille Note Touch Plus. It replaces the
Victor Reader program on older Braille Note devices.

To get started, find and activate the Easy Reader Plus app from the
main menu. You’ll be taken through a setup process of logging into an
Easy Reader account. You can sign in with Google or Facebook to do
most of the work. Then, add a library, like Bookshare. When you want
to get a book, all you have to do is open the navigation panel, go to
the library button, like “Bookshare”, and search for a book. When you
find the one you want, activate it, then choose to download it. You’ll
find it in your library.

## Keyboard commands

The following are useful commands for use with Easy Reader Plus:

* To search a book for a search term or phrase, press **Space with
  f**.
* To add a bookmark at the current location, press **Enter with m**.
* To adjust audio settings, press **Backspace with a**.
* To open the table of contents and a list of your bookmarks, press
  **Backspace with b**.
* To open a menu of more options, press **Space with m**.
* to play or pause the book, press the action button.

## Importing books

In the main interface of Easy Reader Plus, outside of a book, there is
an “import books” button. This lets you import books that you may
already have on your device. They can be in DAISY 2 or 3, or EPUB 2 or
3 formats. When you activate the “import books” button, you can select
the place where the book is saved, then open the book itself. The book
will then appear in your library.
