# Reading Print

The Braille Note Touch Plus comes with an app to scan and read printed
documents. This isn’t perfect, but should get the job done well enough
on a well-lit, neatly typed document. It doesn’t work so well on
handwritten text.

The app, KNFB Reader, is installed on the Braille Note Touch Plus
already. If you want to try out other solutions, there is also the
[Envision](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.letsenvision.envisionai&hl=en_US&gl=US)
app which can be installed with a monthly subscription, but possibly
better results.

When you open KNFB Reader, you’ll be on the capture screen, where you
can take a photo to be scanned. Place the Braille Note Touch Plus on a
flat surface, with the document under it. Then, lift the device off of
the surface, about three to five inches from the document. Then, press
the Action button to take a picture. When the text is recognized, you
can read it in braille, or press **Space with g** to hear it spoken.
You can save the file by navigating the the Save button, and
activating it.
