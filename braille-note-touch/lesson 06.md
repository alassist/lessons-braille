# Writing Documents

The Word Processor, called Keyword, is a document editing app. It is
similar to Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or LibreOffice. It is not as
advanced as these mainstream tools, but does allow for simple
formatting, saving, printing, or embossing. It can open many different
types of files: Microsoft Word (DOCX,DOC), Rich Text (RTF), and Plain
Text (TXT).

To open Keyword, either navigate to “Word Processor : Keyword” in the
Main menu, or press “w” to move directly to it. Then, press Enter or a
Cursor Routing key to open the Keyword menu. Within the menu are the
following items:

* Create
* Open
* Print
* Emboss
* Settings

## Create

The create option opens a new document. It is not saved, so when done
writing, you can press **Space with S** to save it (or choose to save
the file from the context menu), or exit, with the Back button, and
you will be asked if you want to save the file or discard it.

When you create a document, you will be placed into a normal edit
field. You will feel:

⣏⣀⣽

This “box” with a cursor is the braille representation of an edit
field. The opening bracket is the left side of the box, the low dash
in the middle is the cursor, the the right bracket is the right end of
the box. Keyword is a multiline edit field, which means that you
can continue to type, over many lines. The right end of the box will
move to the right further as you type, the cursor moving with it. You can press Enter to create a
new line, and continue typing.

## Open

To open a document, choose “Open” from the Keyword menu. You’ll be
placed inside a file picker. Navigate forward to the folder you want,
using the thumb keys, **Space with dot 4** or just the Space bar, and
choose one with Enter or a Cursor Routing button. Next, find the file
you want to open, and press Enter or a cursor Routing button. The file
opens, and you will feel the name of the document, then the first line
of text in the file. If you are unsure which document you are reading,
press SPACE with I to display document information.

### Editing a file

Now that you’ve either created a new document, or opened an existing
one, you can begin writing. You can type in braille, and the text will
immediately be translated into print. If you don’t like or know the
braille grade that you’re typing in, you can press Backspace with G to
change the braille grade. You can choose between Computer Braille and
Literary Braille.

After typing a document, or while typing, you may wish to edit the
document. You can do so using the following commands:

#### Moving Around Text

  1-2-3**.
