# Getting Help

Now, let’s focus on how to get help with your device. There is help on
the device itself, and help from many other places. All of these
resources can be used to great effect to learn to better use your
device.

## Getting Contextual Help

If you are in an area that you don’t know how to use, you can press
**Space with h** to get help. You’ll receive commands that can be
pressed, current actions you can take, and how to exit the area.

## The Context Menu

If you press **Space with m** or hold down the Recent Apps key, a menu
will open with tasks that can be performed on the current item.

## The User Guide

The user guide, which can be found on the device, in the options menu,
or online, on Humanware’s website, has all that you need to know to
use the device. It is made up of sections which go over each part
and app that comes with the device.

## The Tutorial

The tutorial launches the first time you use the Braille Note Touch
Plus. It teaches you how to use the device. Follow the instructions,
and make use of the interactive sections to complete the tutorial and
learn about the device.
